## Introduction

A golden rule in investing is to always test the portfolio strategy on historical data, and, once you are trading the strategy, to constantly monitor its performance.

* combine portfolio theory with the practice in R,

* and to illustrate on real-life examples of equity portfolios and asset allocation problems.
